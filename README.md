## My process

### Workflow

 - Identifing and Creating Components
    - Layout, Header, Hero, UnderConstruction, SubscribeForm, ComingSoon

 - Working on mobile design based on `desing` folder

 - Working on desktop design based on `desing` folder

 - Working on email validity using React hook

 - Writing README.md

 - Publish on github.com | app.netlify.com | frontmentor.io

### Built with

- React
- React CSS module
- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

As a result, I learned how to think about the structure of a page in terms of components as well as the state of my components. Also, I learned how to install SVG images in React

### Continued development

This is my first challenge that I used React for that

The upcoming challenges will be done using React, so I can practice using it.
